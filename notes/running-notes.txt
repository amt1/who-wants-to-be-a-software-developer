Terminal:  npm install express in terminal window
"server": "node server.js" under test in package.json
Terminal: npm install -D nodemon
"server:dev": "nodemon server.js" in package.json
** CORRECTION server/server.js
npm run server:dev
"build": "webpack -w"  - add this to package.json
Terminal: npm install webpack webpack-cli
npm install mongodb
npm install mocha
"test": "mocha specs" under scripts in package.json
** CORRECTION
This needed changing to
"test": "mocha ./client/src/specs",
as mocha couldn't find the test file
"mocha": "^6.1.4" under devDependencies in package.json

Finally got GET route working in insomnia:
http://localhost:3000/api/pda_questions

(db name is pda_quiz)

Seems URL may be a reserved word in Mongo DB
as I got this error when trying to use it as a key: SyntaxError: missing : after property id
Changed it to Link instead

Got the DB to read in the seeds hash fields by using a combination of double and single quotes ie
correct_answer: "{'true'}",
Will need to test reading from this to make sure it will work.
May be the same as what stringify does anyway?

Trying to get mocha to work
npm install --save-dev mocha

moving specs to same directory as package.json

mongo < seeds.js
