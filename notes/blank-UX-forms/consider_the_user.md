# Consider the user experience

## Before you begin

Before you begin coding, consider stopping for a minute and think about the user of your product.

Ask yourself the following questions:

* What user needs is your product going to answer? Can you document that?
* Why would your users want to use this over something similar that they've seen elsewhere?
* How could you make sure that your website uses interface solutions that users are familiar with?
* What is the user journey — how will users interact with your product, and how many steps will be necessary to complete their goals?

1. Use this [user needs template](https://goo.gl/zHbfud) to document things that people may want from your website
2. Download and print out the [template for the user journey](https://goo.gl/zXkgtZ) — use it to map steps of the journey. Remember about user actions and system responses. What's required for every particular screen?

Make sure to prepare a simple sketch of the website (or a wireframe with UXPin if you wish), sketching out all major steps of the user journey you've identified. Think of potential problems and ways of addressing these in a way that makes the user experience smooth and pleasant.

## After you sketch your website out

Show it to your colleague and ask them how does it come across to them. Don't guide them; give them a goal to complete and listen as they describe their way through your sketches. Can you think of anything that could be improved? If so, sketch quickly and test with the same colleague. See if they think it got any better.

Only then write your code — don't spend time building something that isn't focused on user needs.

### After you're done

* Show your website to a couple of colleagues. Can they use it? Is there anything that could be quickly changed to make it more user-friendly?
* Talk about your experience of planning for the best outcome in your presentation. How did the light touch UX work change the final product? What design decisions did you take after testing it with a friend?
